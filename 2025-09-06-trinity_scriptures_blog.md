# Trinity in Scripture: A Clear Look at God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit Speaking

*Understanding the relationships within the Trinity through their own words*

The Trinity can be one of the most challenging concepts in Christianity to understand. But sometimes the best way to learn about God is to listen to how the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit speak about each other. This collection of Scripture verses from the King James Version shows us these divine relationships in action.

Even Jesus, as both God and man, refers to the Father as "my God":

## Jesus Speaking About the Holy Spirit

Jesus consistently spoke of the Holy Spirit as a distinct person who would come after Him.

> **John 14:16** - "And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever."

### The Spirit's Future Ministry

> *Greek: "en pneumati theou" (by/in Spirit of God) - instrumental case showing means of power*

## God the Father Speaking About Jesus

There are three recorded times in the New Testament when God the Father's voice was heard from heaven, each time speaking about Jesus.

### At Jesus' Baptism
> **Matthew 3:17** - "And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."  
> *Greek: "houtos estin ho huios mou" (this is my son) - demonstrative "houtos" pointing TO another*

> **Luke 3:22** - "And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased."  
> *Greek: "katebē" (descended), "phōnē" (voice), "baptizomenos" - three distinct actions by three persons*

### At the Transfiguration
> **Matthew 17:5** - "While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him."  
> *Greek: "autou akouete" (of him hear) - genitive of person showing whose words to heed*

> **Mark 9:7** - "And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him."

## The Divine Hierarchy in Scripture

The Bible reveals a beautiful order within the Trinity that doesn't diminish equality but shows relationship and function.

### The Clear Chain of Authority
> **1 Corinthians 11:3** - "But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God."  
> *Greek: "kephalē de tou Christou ho theos" (head of Christ is God) - genitive showing headship*

This verse establishes the order: **God → Christ → Man → Woman**

### All Things Flow Through This Order
> **1 Corinthians 3:21-23** - "Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours; Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours; And ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's."  
> *Greek: "hymeis de Christou, Christos de theou" (you of Christ, Christ of God) - genitive chain*

This shows: **All Things → Believers → Christ → God**

### Christ's Ultimate Submission
> **1 Corinthians 15:28** - "And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all."  
> *Greek: "hypotaxēsetai" (will be subjected) - future passive showing ongoing submission*

### Christ as Head Over All Creation
> **Colossians 1:15-18** - "Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature... And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence."  
> *Greek: "eikōn tou theou" (image of God) - genitive showing what he represents*

---

## God Giving Things to Jesus

The epistles clearly show the Father as the one who gives, raises, and exalts the Son.

### God Exalts Jesus
> **Philippians 2:9** - "Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name."  
> *Greek: "ho theos auton hyperypsōsen" (God him highly exalted) - God as subject, Jesus as object*

> **Ephesians 1:20-22** - "Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places... And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church."  
> *Greek: "energēsen en tō Christō" (worked in Christ) - preposition showing God working IN another*

### Jesus at God's Right Hand
> **Romans 8:34** - "Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us."  
> *Greek: "en dexia tou theou" (at right of God) - locative showing position relative to God*

> **Colossians 3:1** - "If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God."  
> *Greek: "en dexia tou theou" (at right of God) - genitive showing whose right hand*

### Standard Epistle Greetings Show the Distinction
Almost every New Testament epistle begins by distinguishing the Father and Son:

> **Romans 1:7** - "Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ."  
> *Greek: "apo theou patros kai kyriou Iēsou" (from God Father and Lord Jesus) - two distinct sources*

> **1 Corinthians 1:3** - "Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ."  
> *Greek: "apo theou patros hēmōn kai apo kyriou Iēsou" (from God our Father and from Lord Jesus) - repeated "apo"*

> **Ephesians 1:2-3** - "Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ."  
> *Greek: "ho theos kai patēr tou kyriou hēmōn Iēsou Christou" (the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ) - genitive relationship*

## What This Means for Us

## What These Scriptures Clearly Show

The Bible presents three distinct persons who speak of each other as separate individuals:

### **God the Father**
- Speaks **about** Jesus: "This is my beloved Son"
- Speaks **to** Jesus: "Thou art my Son" 
- **Gives** things to Jesus: authority, a name above every name, position at His right hand
- Is called "my God" even by Jesus

### **Jesus the Son**
- Speaks **about** the Father: "my Father," "my God," "Him who sent me"
- Speaks **about** the Spirit: "another Comforter," "he will guide you," "whom I will send"
- **Receives** from the Father: glory, authority, inheritance
- **Submits** to the Father: "not my will but thine"

### **The Holy Spirit**
- Is spoken **about** by Jesus: as "he," "him," "another," "the Comforter"
- **Proceeds** from the Father
- Is **sent** by both the Father and the Son
- **Glorifies** Jesus and **testifies** of Him

### **The Clear Hierarchy**
Scripture establishes a functional order without diminishing equality:
- **God** is the head of Christ
- **Christ** is the head of every man  
- **All things** belong to believers, believers belong to Christ, Christ belongs to God

These verses demonstrate that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit consistently relate to each other as distinct persons with different roles, while maintaining perfect unity. They speak to each other, about each other, and function within a clear divine order that Scripture presents without apology or explanation—simply as the reality of who God is.
