## About This Journal

This is where I document the reality of software engineering - not the theory, but what actually happens when code meets production. 

I explore:
- **Legacy system archaeology** - Working in codebases that are 95% technical debt
- **Architectural trade-offs** - Why good beats perfect, and how systems really evolve
- **Industry patterns** - The recurring problems that nobody talks about in interviews
- **Development philosophy** - What we're doing wrong and occasionally right

These aren't polished tutorials or best practice guides. They're honest conversations about the mess we call software engineering, the trade-offs we make, and the patterns that keep repeating across every codebase I've touched.

Some entries are structured essays, others are raw explorations of ideas. All of them come from real experience in the trenches of production systems.
