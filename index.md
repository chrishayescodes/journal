# Welcome to My Daily Journal

*Where software engineering meets biblical wisdom*

---

## About This Journal

This is my public journal where I explore the intersection of technology and faith through daily reflections and technical deep-dives. Here, you'll find honest conversations about software engineering challenges alongside biblical perspectives on life and work.

## What You'll Find Here

### Software Engineering Topics
- **Architecture & Design**: Exploring the tension between perfect code and shipping products, the reality of legacy systems, and the art of managing technical debt
- **Development Philosophy**: Why good software beats perfect software, how to escape "framework prison," and rediscovering simple architectures like CGI
- **Real-World Challenges**: The psychological toll of working in "hoarder house" codebases, dealing with monolithic systems, and the eternal struggle between business needs and technical excellence

### Christian Perspectives
- **Biblical Commentary**: Deep dives into scripture, including systematic examinations of theological concepts like the Trinity through God's own words
- **Faith & Life**: Examining modern issues through a biblical lens, from the dangers of spiritual pride dressed in psychological language to understanding our calling as believers
- **Practical Theology**: How biblical principles apply to software development, work ethics, and daily life

## My Approach

I believe in:
- **Honest exploration** of both technical and spiritual challenges
- **Practical wisdom** over theoretical perfection
- **Learning through conversation** and real-world experience
- **Bridging the gap** between faith and technical excellence

Whether you're here for the software insights or the biblical perspectives (or both!), I hope you find something that challenges your thinking and encourages your journey.
